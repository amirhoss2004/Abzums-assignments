    "# Exercise: AI-Powered Sentiment-Based Conversation Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Create a Python program that uses an AI API to maintain a text-based conversation in a user-specified tone (e.g., 'sarcastically,' 'cheerfully,' 'angrily'). The program should allow users to input messages, receive AI responses, and maintain a conversation history, exiting with specific commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "1. Use the `openai` Python library with AvalAI API (`https://api.mockai.com/v1`).\n",
    "2. Prompt the user for a tone and validate it (not empty).\n",
    "3. Allow users to input messages and continue the conversation until they type 'quit,' 'exit,' or 'stop'.\n",
    "4. Validate user messages (not empty).\n",
    "5. Maintain conversation history by appending user and AI messages.\n",
    "6. Print the full conversation history after each AI response.\n",
    "7. Include error handling for API issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Input/Output\n",
    "**Input**:\n",
    "- Tone: `sarcastically`\n",
    "- Message 1: `What's the weather like today?`\n",
    "- Message 2: `Sounds nice, what's tomorrow like?`\n",
    "- Message 3: `quit`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the tone for the conversation (e.g., sarcastically, cheerfully, angrily): sarcastically\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter your message (or 'quit', 'exit', or 'stop' to end): What's the weather like today?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Response (sarcastically): Oh, just a glorious sunny day, perfect for your pointless outdoor plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversation History:\n",
    "System: Respond sarcastically!\n",
    "User: What's the weather like today?\n",
    "Assistant: Oh, just a glorious sunny day, perfect for your pointless outdoor plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter your message (or 'quit', 'exit', or 'stop' to end): Sounds nice, what's tomorrow like?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Response (sarcastically): Tomorrow? Another thrilling day of clouds, because variety is just too much to ask for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversation History:\n",
    "System: Respond sarcastically!\n",
    "User: What's the weather like today?\n",
    "Assistant: Oh, just a glorious sunny day, perfect for your pointless outdoor plans.\n",
    "User: Sounds nice, what's tomorrow like?\n",
    "Assistant: Tomorrow? Another thrilling day of clouds, because variety is just too much to ask for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter your message (or 'quit', 'exit', or 'stop' to end): quit\n",
    "Ending conversation.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "- Practice structuring API requests with text prompts.\n",
    "- Learn to maintain and update conversation history.\n",
    "- Implement input validation and error handling.\n",
    "- Understand how to control AI response tone via system prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "Complete the TODOs in the code below to build the conversation tool. Test with at least two different tones and multiple messages to ensure the conversation history is maintained correctly."
